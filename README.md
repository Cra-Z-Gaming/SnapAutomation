I saw somone made a Snapscore automater but also noticed its $25??? 
hell no, so i went to my pc, 
and started begging ChatGPT to write code for me :D

This project automates clicking certain buttons on Snapchat Web

Notes:

Everything is open source - you can check the code to make sure itâ€™s safe.

It only interacts with buttons for automation purposes.

I chose Tampermonkey because its a free alternitvate to making my own chrome extention, and it works great with web.
