Step 3 - Setup ---⚠️ONLY WORKS ON WEB SNAPCHAT⚠️--- https://www.snapchat.com/web

----------------------To make my life easier, the snapscore popup is called a GUI so i will say it alot------------------

When you enter snapchat, You should see my GUI
We need to focus on the top 4 buttons 
Cam ON - looks like a camera in the middle, this will enable the camera each time because snapchat turns it off to reduce lag
Picture - takes a picture (make sure you have a camera or use OBS)
Send - clicks the bottom right send button
Final Send - when friend/s selected, there will be another send button

Ok, now that you read nothing, we can start the setup

---REAL SETUP---

make sure you click "turn off your camera" it should be the X on the top left of your camera 
you should see "Click the Camera to send Snaps" - this is what you want

Step 3.1 - In the GUI you will need to click: Cam ON, Picture, Send, Final Send
But make sure you click in the correct order. 
First Click the button with the name, then click the thing on the screen.

Cam ON -> click the grey camera
Picture -> White ring on the button
Send -> Blue "Send To" button
IMPORTANT⚠️ - you will need to DRAG the profile of the person you want to send to INTO the dropbox
then select a random person to make the SEND button apear, 
In the GUI click "Final Send" then click the SEND button on the bottom

Click Start and YOU are done :D (dont put multiple of the same people, it will deselect)
